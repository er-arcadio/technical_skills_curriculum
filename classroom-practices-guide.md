## Guiding Principles
### Five Guiding Principles in Giant Machines Classes

#### 1. Students learn by doing.
Some teacher-led instruction is necessary to introduce new, complex concepts, but most concepts are mastered during independent or collaborative practice. One way of accomplishing this is to aim for a specific ratio, e.g., for every one minute of direct instruction, there should be 2-4 minutes of student-led exploration or problem solving.

#### 2. Success looks different for every student.
Student final projects will demonstrate different levels of mastery of different skills based on prior knowledge in both CS and other disciplines. Not every student needs to create final projects using every tool explored in class. When students produce different levels and types of work while still encouraging one another, it is an indicator of a healthy classroom culture. Students and teachers who choose to see differences in work products as nonhierarchical are actively working to dismantle the imposter syndrome that has plagued and continues to pervade STEM fields.

#### 3. The instructor is not a gatekeeper.
A teacher’s job is to shepherd learning. In computer science classrooms it is impossible for the teacher -and destructive for the students- to expect the teacher to know everything there is to know in this discipline. A teacher must model the intellectual humility embedded in statements like “I’m not sure, let’s look it up together.” and “I haven’t tried that yet - have you?”. When a teacher tries to feign expertise, the scope of student projects is limited to replicating the teacher’s knowledge. When a teacher models what it looks like to confidently not know something, the scope of student projects is expanded to include anything for which there are free online resources available.

#### 4. Discomfort + Safety = Learning.
Encouraging students to “step outside of your comfort zone” is an implicit acknowledgement of the idea that learning happens when prior knowledge or skillsets are insufficient for a new challenge or task. Great learners must become comfortable with discomfort in order to grow their skillsets and mindsets as quickly as possible.

#### 5. Great work happens in teams
Many students in CS express a preference for working alone, but almost every technology that students interact with on a day-to-day basis was built by a team. Protocols like pair programming, morning check ins, and transparent conversations about the value of each person’s unique skillset and perspective can facilitate group work in a productive way.
Student voice matters - One of the most comprehensive and rich sources of feedback a teacher can get is directly from their students. Strong classrooms offer students many opportunities to provide feedback through surveys or similar other mechanisms on their learning (“Was it enjoyable? Do you feel confident? Was it hard?”) as often as every single day.

## Morning Routine

#### Environment

In the morning, you'll want to arrive at least 30 minutes before students (1 hour on your first day). Here is a general checklist of observable indicators in an excellent classroom:
* There is a [clear activity](#to-do) for students to do (either culture-building or academic review).
* That day's schedule is on the board.
* If seats are assigned (which is usually a helpful way of making students meet and work with new people), there is a visual indicator of where students will sit.
* Music (generally a playlist curated by students) is playing.
* Teachers are engaging students in conversation.
* Teachers are addressing students by name.

###### Post objectives
Consider also posting the day's objectives. Having the list of skills students will learn that day visible can be a reassuring anchor for students who begin to feel unmoored. A lot of the emotional mediation we do involves telling students "you're not behind, we're just moving very quickly," so the daily objectives gives you a talking point in one-on-one conversations with students: "Do you know how to do this? What about this? And this? Okay, then you're actually doing great!"

### To-do

Each day, you'll want a consistent place where students can look to find the first activity for the day. You want something they can start independently, and in staggered groups, as some students will arrive quite early. Post the activity either somewhere in the room, or some consistent location in Slack.

At 9:00 exactly, acknowledge that class has started, thank those who are there for being on time, and then direct them to the to-do.

Good to-dos:
* On the first day, have your TA sign students up for slack, and have the to-do be some sort of internet scavenger hunt, like posting your favorite music video, recipe, or piece of visual art.
* A review game like Terminus or Sushi selector
* A teacher-made review activity (like a solo Kahoot or repl.it challenge)
* Unfinished labs from previous days
* Blog post readings, either academic or non-cognitive (resource list coming soon!)

### Pre-launch

At 9:00, get everyone's attention, announce that it is 9:00, thank everyone for being there on time, and officially launch whatever activity you expect students to work on during the first 15 minutes. This allows us a small window to let stragglers filter in, and gives you time to see how well students remember the previous day's content.

Sometimes stragglers start to rely on on this time as buffer time which gives them implicit permission to arrive late, and if that happens, it can be helpful to start class EXACTLY on time at 9:00 instead.

### Launch

At about 9:15, you'll want to get everyone out of their chairs to start the day.

Giant Machines favorites include:
* Stretch and Share
* Contact
* Draw the Moon/Pass the hat
* Crazy Eights

### Review Microfeedback

Starting on day 2, one of the most important (but also easily forgettably) moments is reviewing the microfeedback from the previous day. This is an important way to acknowledge trends in the classroom to make students who are experiencing imposter syndrome to feel validated in their insecurities. It's also important to use this time to show how the microfeedback informs what we do so that students understand how important it is that they give us as much information as possible.

Here's the general pattern:
* We wanted to take a quick moment to review yesterday's microfeedback.
* Thanks again, everyone, for taking it so seriously. It really helps us know how to best plan out the next day.
* Name the trends:
    * Ex: Yesterday, (about half / most / several) of you said the day was hard. In particular, you mentioned (arrays / objects) as the toughest part.
* Name the big take-away - feel free to recycle the wording from this list:
    * **Pull Groups:** We're actually going to launch the day with a 30-minute review for anyone who wants to cover it. If you feel good about arrays, there's an array activity in Slack that you can do to challenge yourself while we go over this with everyone else.
    * **Normalize Struggle:** Seven people mentioned that we're moving really fast - that's totally true. *We're going to slow down a little bit*, but we also wanted to encourage you that fast isn't bad. You're actually writing really strong code and wrestling with really complicated concepts, so even if it doesn't feel like you've mastered it, you're not nearly as lost as you might feel. You're all doing really well, even if it feels fast.
    * **Reframe Problem:** A few people mentioned that they'd rather work alone. I totally understand; I'm a solo-project person myself. That said, there are two reasons we're going to keep challenging you to work together:
        1. Great things are built in teams. This is a rare opportunity for you to be in a team with other people who are at (or really close to) your same level. Once you leave here, you'll ONLY be able to work alone - so make the most of the chance to build something together while you can.
        2. On a practical level, there are only two of us, and there are 16 of you. So if all these groups work alone, we can only support a tiny fraction of the class. Until you get really good at debugging alone, we NEED you to have a partner built in to support you through this process.
    * **Calm Nervousness:** Yesterday, we had more people in the panic zone than ever before. Thanks for being honest with us about that. We know it can be intimidating to admit when something is hard. Even though it can be scary to spend a large part of a day in your panic zone, we aren't worried, because that was one of the hardest days in the whole two weeks. We're really proud of you for persevering. If you felt intimidated, you aren't alone, and you aren't behind. You're exactly where you need to be. We're going to slow down and review just the most important concepts from yesterday. If you understand the 5 things we cover in this review session, awesome - you're ready to move ahead. If you're still feeling a little nervous after the review, just let us know.
    * **Pre-mortem Nervousness:** Today, we're going to cover Sinatra. This is the hardest thing we'll do over the entire two weeks. We're going to move as slowly as we can, and I'm going to check in a lot, but just know that it's normal to panic a little bit today. If you *are* feeling confident, that's awesome - so please *use* that confidence to check in with your neighbor, help them debug, and encourage them. If everyone around you seems to be doing okay, but it still takes us a minute to move ahead, please be patient - maybe even find a way to experiment with your code.
* BEFORE the day starts or after this launch, it's totally appropriate to follow up with individual students who have unique or worrying survey results.
    * Ex: "I noticed you put just 'okay' on your survey, and I wanted to ask what I can do to make today excellent. We were thinking about taking a break and also sitting you next to Javi, since he's really confident with syntax, and that seems to be what scared you the most. Do either of those sound helpful?"

##### What NOT to do:
* Do not single out anyone by name.
* Do not single anyone out by number.
    * For example, if only one student put "panic zone", then say "we had some panic zones." If you say "only one student put 'panic zone'!" then you make room for that student to feel embarrassed about their feelings.
* Do not approach a student individually until the rest of the class is otherwise occupied in some way.

### Late Students

Inevitably, a few students will roll in late. We ultimately want these students to arrive on time so that we aren't forced to choose between holding up the class to wait on them, or launching without them and leaving them behind. You'll want to have a private, low-pressure conversation with them. Here's a sample script of how that conversation might go.

> "Hey David, I noticed that you got here late - just wanted to check in and make sure you're able to get here on time in the mornings. Were you able to figure out what trains to take to get here on time?"
>
> "I understand. Yeah, traffic can be really tricky. I'm actually here as early as 8:30, so if you wanted to aim to get here by then, you could - that way if you're delayed, you still won't miss anything.
>
> "That's actually the main reason I'm concerned. Of course, we want to make sure you're safe, and we also start our day right on time. When someone's late, the teacher has to choose between waiting for them to start (so the day starts late and we can't fit everything in) or starting without them and just hoping they can catch up.
>
> "I know you'll do your best to be here on time, but if you're ever late again, would you rather we wait up for you, or launch without you?"

If a student is late, it's usually because they're planning to arrive right on time (not early) and so one delay, traffic slowdown, or missed connection means they're wildly off schedule. Assume the best in students, but also encourage them to plan to be early.

It is possible that students may not be arriving early because they feel socially out-of-place and do not like the mostly unstructured to-do time from 9:00-9:15. That's why making sure they know that their presence/absence/punctuality affects the entire learning environment can be helpful perspective. Make it clear that those first 15 minutes of class are purposeful, even if they lack structure. It may also be more productive to do the official launch of class exactly at 9:00, and move the review activities to 9:15. Inverting the structure in this way allows you to make it clear that class really does start at 9:00.

It is **critical** that your tone in this conversation is honest and solutions-oriented. The goal is not to make the student feel guilty, but instead to help the student understand why we care if they are late.

While the exact details of this conversation may change for a student who is late to a videoconference, the core concern and core goal are both the same: if the student is able to arrive / join the videoconference on time, we don't have to make the hard choice of starting to cover content without them. 

## Improv Games

   
| Game | Rules | Tags |
|------|-------|------|
| Rock-paper-scissors championship | Everyone looks around for an opponent. They play best-of-three rock-paper-scissors. The winner continues in search of another opponent. The loser becomes one of a growing crowd of people behind the winner and chants their name in all subsequent challenges. This continues, with winners gradually adding to their crew until only two champions (and their supporting crowds) remain. Those two go head to head and the final winner is celebrated by everyone. | Large groups <br> Loud <br> High-energy <br> Low risk |
| Evolution | Everyone begins as an egg. Each player looks around for an opponent who is the same rank as they are. They play best-of-three rock-paper-scissors. The winner is promoted to the next rank. The loser is demoted to the previous rank. The cycle repeats until someone ascends. The ranks are: egg -> chicken -> velociraptor -> immortal -> ascended | Medium groups <br> Loud <br> High-energy <br> Low risk |
| Debugger | One person is designated as the debugger and sent away from the group. The group devises a rule to govern their behavior while the psychiatrist is away. When the psychiatrist returns, the group follows the agreed-upon rule, and the psychiatrist must deduce the rule. Some example rules: <br> <ul> <li>Everyone with glasses lies</li> <li>Every answer must start with the first letter of your own name</li> <li>Designate a "controller" and lie if and only if his/her legs are crossed</li> <li>Alternate lies and truth</li> </ul> | Small / med groups <br> Quiet <br> calming <br> logical / cerebral <br> Med risk |
| Contact | One player is designated the wordmaster and thinks of a word, which must be a common noun. The wordmaster gives the first letter of the word. For example, if the word is "crocodile", they'll say "C". Other players will think of words that start with C. If a player thinks of a word like "corn", they'll describe that thing, like "it grows on a cob!" If another player thinks they know what word that first player is thinking of, they'll look at that player, shout "CONTACT!" and then start counting up to 10 and try to say the word together: "1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-CORN!" If they successfully do this without getting blocked, the wordmaster will give an additional letter, (in this case "C-R") <br><br> The wordmaster can block a contact countdown by interrupting with the word they're thinking of - in this case, by saying "IT'S NOT CORN!" - before the players get to it. If the players are blocked, or if they say TWO DIFFERENT WORDS, the block is unsuccessful and they have to start over. <br><br> The game ends when a player tries to make contact on the wordmaster's word (which he/she cannot block). Even if the contact is unsuccessful, the player who said the correct word wins and becomes the next round's wordmaster. | Small / med groups <br> Quiet <br> Medium-energy <br> Low risk |
| Categories - elimination | Players stand in a semicircle and the teacher is the conductor. The conductor announces a category for the round. The conductor prefaces this game by saying "I will be the completely unfair and arbitrary judge. If you say 'light blue' and I don't think that's a color or I just don't like that answer, then you're out! If you repeat an answer or if you hesitate too long, you're out!" Then the conductor points to players in random order until a player repeats another player's answer or hesitates. That player is out. Repeat until one player remains. | Small / med groups <br> Medium-energy <br> Low risk <br> Teacher-moderated <br> Elimination |
| Categories - the chain | Players stand in a circle. Teacher announces a category. Players raise one hand. Starting player points to a player accross the circle from them and names something from the category, and then *that* player does the same to someone else. This continues until there is only one player left, and that player points back to the starting player. Pass the energy by repeating those exact same items. Make the game harder by removing the pointing or by getting multiple categories going at once. | Large / med groups <br> Quiet <br> Focus <br> Communication <br> High risk |
| Yee-haw! | This game is a pass-the-energy game: <ul> <li>YEE-HAW! - pass left/right</li> <li>Oil slick - skip the next person, but continue the direction</li> <li>Get along lil' doggie - send across to anyone not a neighbor</li> <li>Get off my porch! - reject a 'get along'</li> <li>Rope - switch places with someone, and it's still your turn!</li> <li>Four-shifter gearbox! - Everyone takes one step in, and fist pumps to "1-2-3-4!"</li> </ul> | Large / med groups <br> Loud <br> High-energy <br> High risk  |
| Ninja | Everyone stands shoulder-to-shoulder and jumps back. Players take turns making one fluid motion to attack their neighbors (who are vulnerable only from elbow to wrist). If you hit your neighbor, they lose their arm. Then your turn is over. Freeze until you either must dodge an attack or until your next turn. | Any size group <br> Mostly quiet <br> Active <br> Elimination |
| Alliterated Names | Each person comes up with an adjective that describes them and is alliterative with their first name (e.g. "Tyrannical Taylor"). They then say this name and perform an action to accompany the description. The group mirrors their action back at them. We go around the circle twice, and then this becomes a standard energy passing game, where you perform your own action and say your own phrase top receive the energy, and you say someone else's phrase and perform their action to send the energy to them. | Ice breaker <br> focus |
| Sculptures | Three players. The first strikes a pose behind or otherwise out of sight of the second. The third tries to coach the second into the exact same position using only their words (no gestures). | |
| Group Counting Game | Everyone stands in a tight circle, shoulder to shoulder, takes a deep breath in, then a deep breath out. Then, without looking up, signaling, or otherwise prompting, a player says "one" and takes a step back out of the circle. The goal for each player to say one number. If two players speak or move at the same time, the game starts over. Repeat until victorious. | Calming <br> Focus <br> Teamwork |
| Bippity Bippity Bop | You kind of have to see this one to understand it. | |
| WAH | This is a waltz. On beat one, the receiver of the energy lifts his hands above his head and says "wah!". On beat two, his neighbors chop in and both say "wah!".  On beat 3, he chops down and sends the energy to the next recipient. The cycle repeats <br><br> A player sits down when he/she breaks tempo or does an incorrect action. The circle does not contract to exclude the seated players, but the immediate neighbors are always the nearest *standing* players. Repeat until 2 or 3 remain and either declare them co-victors or play a tiebreaker. |
| Bowl of Spaghetti | You kind of have to see this one to understand it. | |
| Game of Threes | Three players. For example. The first player strikes a pose and says "I'm a chicken!" The second player strikes a pose and says "I'm a farmer!" The third player strikes a pose and brings it all together by saying "I'm an egg!" The last player stays in and becomes the first player in the next round. <br><br> This game is super quick, so if each round only takes a few seconds, that's fine. The goal is to make choices quickly without worrying whether they are the very best possible choices.  | |
| Nose Typing | Have students pull up a blank text file, word document, or google doc. Then project a sentence (without apostrophes) on the board. Then have them reproduce the sentence perfectly using ONLY their noses. |
| Seven Things | In a circle, first student says a category. Next student has to say seven words related to that category while the rest of the group counts them off. There are no wrong answers so if you can't think of anything in the category, SAY ANYTHING! Then the student who gave the seven words gives the next category to the following student. | |
| Robot-Controller | Only possible to play if you have space. 4 controllers, 4 blindfolded 'robots'. The controllers are assigned a robot to direct. There are rolls of toilet paper thrown on the floor. The controller needs to get the robot to pick up a toilet paper and then hit one of the other robots with it. Last robot standing wins. | |


## Troubleshooting & Debugging

##### Here are some guiding principles for debugging:
* Demonstrate the PEP (Personal Empowerment Protocol)
    * Google it
    * Ask a peer
    * Ask a TA
    * Ask a teacher
* Prompt students to “rubber duck” their code by talking through the logic of their code. Follow the flow of data.
* Give them the exact keywords of what to enter into their search bar, and explain how you chose those words. Then tell them to keep trying for three minutes, and to flag you down if they are still stuck three minutes from now.
* Help students to spot their syntax errors
    * Script puts / console.log statements to debug.
    * Comparing their code to functioning code:
        * Ex: “What’s different about the way you did it on line 17, where it worked, and what’s on line 21, where it didn’t?”
* For major conceptual gaps, pseudocode on whiteboards/paper so they have something worth translating.
* Flag these misunderstandings to your co-teacher and/or TA privately.

##### Writing Debug Statements
In particular, the hardest skill to train is using print / puts / console.log statements to make information visible. Here's a good series of questions you can ask to help students learn to *write their own* debugging statements:
* Which part isn't working? Can you write a debug statement to see if that line is running?
* What's inside that variable? How do you know? Can you write a debug statement to see if you're right?
* What datatype is inside that variable?

##### What not to do
When debugging, there are a few missteps that teachers make. Here's a quick list of high-level "DO NOT" statements for you.
* DO NOT touch the student keyboard Use words to coach them to solving their own errors.
* DO NOT use statements like "stupid error" or "so easy" to describe the error. The intent is usually to calm students, but it has the opposite effect.
* DO NOT simply navigate them to the solution. Add in print statements to help students see what you see.
* DO NOT read their errors for them. Ask students to read those errors to you instead.

## Closing & Microfeedback

### End on time
You will ALWAYS want to let class run longer than it should. Students will be moments away from finishing their code. They'll beg for three more minutes. In short **you MUST have enough time to debrief the day, call for shoutouts, and frame the microfeedback.**

### Celebrate!
As students come over to the closing circle, high five each student and tell them they did a good job today. Offer them precise praise based on their perseverance and their control of their attitude. Thank them for moments you saw them helping other students.

### Shout outs!
Ask each of your students to call out one person who helped them, who worked hard, who persevered through frustration, or who helped foster a positive attitude in the space today.

### Wins!
Ask each student to acknowledge one time they persevered through difficulty, challenged themselves, controlled their attitude, or called themselves back into the learning zone from either of the extreme zones.

### Review that day's content
Pull out that day's objectives and show them to students. Identify any that weren't taught (so that students know that you don't expect them to know items that were stretch objectives or that were cut for time), and then either solicit feedback on the spot, or encourage students that if some of these objectives need to be reviewed or retaught, that they should please point that out in their microfeedback, and you can make a plan to review it for the class or in small groups the next day.

### General gratitude
Thank the students for their focus, attention, and perseverance today. Acknowledge that today was probably challenging for some, and encourage them that even if they didn't feel comfortable sharing frustrations in the closing circle, we'd still love to hear it in their microfeedback. Here's what that might sound like:

> "We're ending with 6 minutes left in class so that you have time to give us really detailed feedback. Again, if today was awesome, that's GREAT! Please tell us why so we can keep making all the days this awesome. If today could have been better, please let us know how. We want to get better at our jobs, and the more we hear from you, the better able we are to do that. The name box is optional, so if you're feeling uncomfortable sharing something personal, feel free to leave it blank. But if you don't care, or if you're asking for something specific like "I need help with the command line", *please* put your name - that way we know who to check in with when we review those conceps.
>
> There's no required length for any of the boxes, but we find about 2-3 sentences per box is usually a good amount for us to learn what we need to do in order to do our job well.
