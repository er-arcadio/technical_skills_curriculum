# Create your own tests for the following problems. 

first_monkey = "Alpha"
monkeys = {
    "Delta": "Echo",
    "Charlie": "Delta",
    "Alpha": "Beta",
    "Beta": "Charlie",
    "Foxtrot": None,
    "Echo": "Foxtrot"
}


# 1 - Print the monkey Alpha is holding


# 2 - Write a function that prints all the monkeys in their current order.


# 3 - Foxtrot is on vacation. Create a function pop() that eliminates the last monkey, from the chain but not from the dictionary.


# 4 - Charlie is on family leave. Create a function remove(NAME) that eliminates the named monkey from the chain but not from the dictionary.
# Then, remove Charlie.



# 5 - Note: if you remove Alpha, that would mess with the first_monkey variable. Adjust your function to account for this. 


# 6 - Foxtrot is back! Create a function append(NAME) that adds the monkey to the end of the list.  Then, add Foxtrot.


# 7 - Charlie is also back! Create a function insert(NAME, AFTER) that adds a monkey after a specified other monkey

# 8 - [Spicy] - Write a function that flips the chain upsidedown. 
# Foxtrot should be the first monkey, and Alpha the last.
