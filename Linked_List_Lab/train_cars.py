# Challenges
# For each challenge, do not use dictionary or list methods 


# -- Mild --

# Print the first train's data

# What color is the second train in sequence? (without peaking at the data)

# Write a function `print_trains(train_cars, first_train)` that prints all the train cars in sequence order


# -- Medium --

new_train = {
    "id": 777,
    "color": "red",
    "weight": 9112,

}

# Write a function `append(train)` that adds a new train to the end of the linked list.
# Be sure to check your results

# Write a function `pop()` that removes the last item of the linked list

# Write a function `insert(idx, train)` that inserts the new_train at a specified index and returns the ID of the first_train

# Write a function `remove(idx)` that removes a train from the chain (but not the dictionary) and returns the ID of the first_train
