## Intro

- Use bubble, selection, or insertion sort and the app to explain an algorithm, the repeatable steps that lead to a sorted list of numbers. 
- Demo how you would transfer that over into code
- Have students select a strategy they're most comfortable with (if their unsure or stuck,  any other above algo will do -- but they can pick their own.)

- after some time showcase students' code

- LAB
- challenge problems that use critical thinking and less so the algorithms themselves.
