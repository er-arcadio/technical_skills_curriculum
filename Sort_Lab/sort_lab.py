# 1. Create an algorithm that does an insertion sort of the sample numbers list from smallest to largest






# 2. Create an algorithm that does a bubble sort of the sample numbers list from smallest to largest





# 3. Create an algorithm that does a selection sort of the sample numbers list from smallest to largest




'''
4. Pause and discuss. Which algorithm is the most "efficient"? Explain your answer considering how each handles:
    - Number of observations
    - Number of iterations/cycles
    - Number of movements of items
'''





# 5. Spicy. Update your three algorithms to sort values from largest to smallest.







# 6. Spicier. Update your three algorithms to sort the list of student dictionaries by a provided key (name, age, or occupation)
# E.g. sort(sample_data.students, "occupation") returns list sorted based on their occupation





# 7. Create a merge sort algorithm to sort the numbers list.








# 8. Create a merge sort algorithm to sort the list of student dictionaries by a provided key (name, age, or occupation)
