## Intro

Sally Sanchez was a splendid secretary. The big boss has a ton of files that Sally organized and they made a program to remember the file structure. It looks something like this (but these aren't the exact files).

Sally fortunately moved on to a better job, and you are now taking their place.

## The Lab

- Open the `main.py`. This is where you will be writing all of your code. The `boss_files.py` is what Sally was working on before they left.
