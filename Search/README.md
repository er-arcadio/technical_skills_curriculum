# Linear vs Binary Search

## Launch

1. Open up the ["Design a Search" app](https://jolson615.github.io/createasearchalgorithm/index.html).

2. See if you can find 50 or prove its not there. Try to come up with a repeatable strategy and make note of any patterns.

> Teacher Note: The 2 key strategies to illustrate here are linear search (tedious) and binary search.

3. What's the fewest and most click you'd need searching linearly? What about using binary search?

## Lesson Walkthrough

Think of a number between 1 and 100, and I'm going to try to guess it. Tell me whether your number is higher or lower after each guess. Can you write this code?

1. In the `binarySearch.py`, write the code for a game that guesses a number between 1-100 that the user is thinking of. The user should enter "yes",  "higher", or "lower" after each guess.
    a. First, have the computer guess the number using linear search. 
    b. Then, change the code so that it guesses using binary search.

> Teacher Note: consider playing the game with a student to demo both algorithms.

2. What are the fewest and most guesses the computer will need in both instances?
